## Intro

Quantum computers exploit quantum mechanics properties to carry out calculations.

- **Superposition**. Any two (or more) quantum states can be added together ("superposed") and the result will be another valid quantum state; and conversely, that every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more other distinct states. Aquantum logical qubit state is a quantum superposition of the "basis states" | 0 ⟩ and | 1 ⟩. Here | 0 ⟩ is the Dirac notation for the quantum state that will always give the result 0 when converted to classical logic by a measurement. Contrary to a classical bit that can only be in the state corresponding to 0 or the state corresponding to 1, a qubit may be in a superposition of both states. This means that the probabilities of measuring 0 or 1 for a qubit are in general neither 0.0 nor 1.0, and multiple measurements made on the same qubits will not always give the same result.
- **Entanglement**. Lack of independence. In quantum theory, states are described by mathematical objects called wave functions. The rules connecting wave functions to physical probabilities introduce very interesting complications. [[1]](https://www.quantamagazine.org/entanglement-made-simple-20160428/) 
- **Interference**. [[2]](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Quantum_Computation#Quantum_Interference_and_Decoherence) [[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt8gVXDsh7Q)

Several equivalent *models* have been developed for this paradigm. We'll focus on quantum circuits.

### Computational complexity

Bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP) is the class of decision problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time, with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances. A decision problem is a member of BQP if there exists a quantum algorithm (an algorithm that runs on a quantum computer) that solves the decision problem with high probability and is guaranteed to run in polynomial time.

Relation between BQP and NP is unknown.

### Computations

Every computation has three elements: data, operations and results. In quantum circuits:

- Data is **qubits**
- Operations are **quantum gates** (unitary transformations)
- Results are **measurements**

### Qubit
